        <h2 id="gandhi_heading">Mahatma Gandhi</h2>
        <img id="gandhi_img" src="download.jpg"><br><br>
        <p id="gandhi_para">
            Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was an Indian lawyer, anti-colonial nationalist and political 
            ethicist who employed nonviolent resistance to lead the successful campaign for India's 
            independence from British rule, and to later inspire movements for civil rights and freedom 
            across the world. and to later inspire movements for civil rights and freedom across the world. 
            The honorific Mahātmā (Sanskrit: "great-souled", "venerable"), first applied to him in 1914 in 
            South Africa, is now used throughout the world.<br><br> Born and raised in a Hindu family in coastal 
            Gujarat, Gandhi trained in the law at the Inner Temple, London, and was called to the bar at
            age 22 in June 1891. After two uncertain years in India, where he was unable to start a 
            successful law practice, he moved to South Africa in 1893 to represent an Indian merchant in 
            a lawsuit. He went on to live in South Africa for 21 years. It was here that Gandhi raised a 
            family and first employed nonviolent resistance in a campaign for civil rights. In 1915, aged 
            45, he returned to India and soon set about organising peasants, farmers, and urban labourers 
            to protest against excessive land-tax and discrimination. Assuming leadership of the Indian
            National Congress in 1921, Gandhi led nationwide campaigns for easing poverty, expanding women's 
            rights, building religious and ethnic amity, ending untouchability, and, above all, achieving 
            swaraj or self-rule. Gandhi adopted the short dhoti woven with hand-spun yarn as a mark of 
            identification with India's rural poor. He began to live in a self-sufficient residential 
            community, to eat simple food, and undertake long fasts as a means of both introspection and 
            political protest.<br><br> Bringing anti-colonial nationalism to the common Indians, Gandhi led them 
            in challenging the British-imposed salt tax with the 400 km (250 mi) Dandi Salt March in 1930 and 
            in calling for the British to quit India in 1942. He was imprisoned many times and for many years 
            in both South Africa and India. Gandhi's vision of an independent India based on religious 
            pluralism was challenged in the early 1940s by a Muslim nationalism which demanded a separate 
            homeland for Muslims within British India. In August 1947, Britain granted independence, but 
            the British Indian Empire was partitioned into two dominions, a Hindu-majority India and a 
            Muslim-majority Pakistan. As many displaced Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs made their way to their new lands, 
            religious violence broke out, especially in the Punjab and Bengal. Abstaining from the official 
            celebration of independence, Gandhi visited the affected areas, attempting to alleviate distress. 
            In the months following, he undertook several hunger strikes to stop the religious violence. The last 
            of these, begun in Delhi on 12 January 1948 when he was 78, also had the indirect goal of pressuring 
            India to pay out some cash assets owed to Pakistan. Although the Government of India relented, as did 
            the religious rioters, the belief that Gandhi had been too resolute in his defence of both Pakistan and 
            Indian Muslims, especially those besieged in Delhi, spread among some Hindus in India.<br><br> Among these 
            was Nathuram Godse, a militant Hindu nationalist from western India, who assassinated Gandhi by firing 
            three bullets into his chest at an interfaith prayer meeting in Delhi on 30 January 1948. Gandhi's 
            birthday, 2 October, is commemorated in India as Gandhi Jayanti, a national holiday, and worldwide 
            as the International Day of Nonviolence. Gandhi is commonly, though not formally, considered the 
            Father of the Nation in India and was commonly called Bapu (Gujarati: endearment for 
            father, papa).

        <h2 id="cooperation_heading">Non-cooperation movement</h2>
        <img id="cooperate_img" src="cooperate_img.jpeg"><br><br>
        <p id="cooperation_para">
            The Non-cooperation movement was a political campaign launched on 4 September 1920, by Mahatma Gandhi to have Indians revoke their cooperation from the British government, with the aim of persuading them to grant self-governance.

This came as result of the Indian National Congress (INC) withdrawing its support for British reforms following the Rowlatt Act of 18 March 1919—which suspended the rights of political prisoners in sedition trials, and was seen as a "political awakening" by Indians and as a "threat" by the British — Which led to the Jallianwala Bagh massacre of 13 April 1919.

The movement was one of Gandhi’s first organized acts of large-scale satyagraha.<br><br> Gandhi's planning of the non-cooperation movement included persuading all Indians to withdraw their labour from any activity that "sustained the British government and also economy in India," including British industries and educational institutions. Through non-violent means, or Ahimsa, protesters would refuse to buy British goods, adopt the use of local handicrafts, and picket liquor shops. In addition to promoting "self-reliance" by spinning khadi, buying Indian-made goods only, and boycotting British goods, Gandhi's non-cooperation movement called for the restoration of the Khilafat (Khilafat movement) in Turkey and the end to untouchability. This resulted in publicly-held meetings and strikes (hartals), which led to the first arrests of both Nehru and his father, Motilal Nehru, on 6 December 1921.

The non-cooperation movement was among the broader movement for Indian independence from British rule and ended, as Nehru described in his autobiography, "suddenly" on 4 February 1922 after the Chauri Chaura incident.<br><br> Subsequent independence movements were the Civil Disobedience Movement and the Quit India Movement.

Though intended to be non-violent, the movement was eventually called off by Gandhi in February 1922 following the Chauri Chaura incident. After police open fired on a crowd of protesters, killing and injuring several, the protesters followed the police back to their station and burned it down, killing the shooters and several other police inside. Nonetheless, the movement marked the transition of Indian nationalism from a middle-class basis to the masses.

        <h3><u>Factors leading to the non-cooperation movement</u></h3>
        <p id="factors_para">
            The non-cooperation movement was a reaction towards the oppressive policies of the British Indian government such as the Rowlatt Act of 18 March 1919, as well as towards the Jallianwala massacre of 13 April 1919.

The Rowlatt Act of 1919, which suspended the rights of political prisoners in sedition trials, was seen as a "political awakening" by Indians and as a "threat" by the British. Although it was never invoked and declared void just a few years later, the Act motivated Gandhi to conceive the idea of satyagraha (truth), which he saw as synonymous with independence.

Motivation for Gandhi's movement was further solidified following the events of 13 April 1919, when a large crowd had gathered at Jallianwala Bagh near the Golden Temple in Amritsar to protest against the arrest of Saifuddin Kitchlew and Dr. Satyapal, while others had come to attend the annual Baisakhi festival. The civilians were fired upon by soldiers under the command of Brigadier-General Reginald Dyer, resulting in killing and injuring thousands of protesters. The outcry generated by the massacre led to thousands of unrests and more deaths by the hands of the police. The massacre became the most infamous event of British rule in India.

Gandhi, who was a preacher of nonviolence, was horrified. 
<img id="rowlatt" src="rowlatt_act.png"><br>
He lost all faith in the goodness of the British government and declared that it would be a "sin" to cooperate with the "satanic" government. Likewise, the idea of satyagraha was subsequently authorised by Jawaharlal Nehru, for who the massacre also endorsed "the conviction that nothing short of independence was acceptable."

Gandhi derived his ideologies and inspiration from ongoing non-cooperation movements, particularly that by Satguru Ram Singh, who is credited as being the first Indian to use non-cooperation and boycott of British merchandise and services as a political weapon.

In response to the Jallianwala Bagh massacre and other violence in Punjab, the movement sought to secure Swaraj, independence for India. Gandhi promised Swaraj within one year if his non-cooperation programme was fully implemented. The other reason to start the non-cooperation movement was that Gandhi lost faith in constitutional methods and turned from cooperator of British rule to non-cooperator campaigning for Indian independence from colonialism.

Other causes include economic hardships to the common Indian citizen, which the nationalists attributed to the economic exploitation of India under colonial rule, the hardships faced Indian artisans due to British factory-made goods replacing handmade goods, and conscription being employed by the British Indian Army to gather enough recruits during the First World War.

    <h3><u>Impact and suspension</u></h3>
        <img id="impact_img" src="impact_img.jpg"><br><br>
        <p id="impact_para">
            The impact of the revolt was a total shock to British authorities and a massive support to 
            millions of Indian nationalists. Unity in the country was strengthened and many Indian schools 
            and colleges were created.<br><br> Indian goods were encouraged. On 5 February 1922 a massacre took 
            place at Chauri Chaura, a small town in the district of Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh. A police officer 
            had attacked some volunteers picketing a liquor shop. A whole crowd of peasants that had gathered 
            there went to the police chowki (station). The mob set fire to the police chowki with some 22 
            policemen inside it. Mahatma Gandhi felt that the revolt was veering off-course, and was 
            disappointed with the rise of violent nature of the movement. He did not want the movement to 
            degenerate into a contest of violence, with police and angry mobs attacking each other back and 
            forth, victimizing civilians in between. Gandhi appealed to the Indian public for all resistance 
            to end, went on a fast and on 12 February 1922 called off the non-cooperation movement. Gandhi was 
            also a firm believer of STS (struggle truce struggle).<br><br> He believed that after a 
            duration of struggle, there should be a resting phase by which they could recover the power and 
            rise again more strong and powerful. Though this point is not mentioned but every 
            movement led by Gandhi was withdrawn by him after a year or two.
        </p>

    <h3><u>End of non-cooperation</u></h3>
    <img id="end_img" src="end2_img.png"><br><br>
    <p id="end_para">
        The Non-cooperation movement was withdrawn after the Chauri Chaura incident. Although he had stopped 
        the national revolt single-handedly, on 12 Feb 1922, Mahatma Gandhi was arrested.<br><br> On 18 March 1922, 
        he was imprisoned for six years for publishing seditious materials. This led to the suppression of the 
        movement and was followed by the arrest of other leaders. Although most Congress leaders remained 
        firmly behind Gandhi, the determined leaders broke away, including the Ali brothers 
        (Shaukat Ali and Mohammad Ali Jouhar). Motilal Nehru and Chittaranjan Das formed the Swaraj Party, 
        rejecting Gandhi's leadership.<br><br> Many nationalists had felt that the non-cooperation movement should not 
        have been stopped due to isolated incidents of violence, and most nationalists while retaining 
        confidence in Gandhi, were discouraged.
